# Mac-s-Memory-Game

This Project was the first coding challenge I ever completed, in May of 2019!

The goal was to create a memory game, where the user's objective is to match each tile with a duplicate until all tiles are overturned. Remember where each face is as you go, and see if you can beat my high score of 23!

This project was done completely in HTML. Since completing it, I went through a coding bootcamp called Rithm, in San Francisco, where I learned Python, Flask, React, Redux, Node, Express, Javascript, SQL, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, jQuery, HTML/CSS and more!
